        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>At Painformance™, we believe athletes could always push harder—if they’d just stop listening to their bodies. Why rest when you can wrap it, numb it, or tape it into submission? Our elite suite of tools helps you overcome pesky things like bones, joints, and consciousness to reach your performance peak. Start winning—by ignoring common sense.</p>

        <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
        <p>We are the champions of pain. The warriors who thrive in discomfort. At Painformance™, we reject the weakling notion of recovery. Our philosophy is simple: to truly excel, one must embrace the agony and push beyond the limits of reason. Why bother with breaks, rest, or recovery? The only thing stopping you from victory is your body’s weak cry for relief. So, we say—silence it. Wrap it. Tape it. Numb it. Pain is just a challenge to be overcome on the path to greatness.</p>
        <p>We are not here to help you heal; we are here to help you dominate. In every injury, there is a chance to prove how far you can go. You are not defined by your limits. At Painformance™, you become your pain. Embrace it, and you will rise above the rest. Are you ready to join the fight? Start now.</p>
